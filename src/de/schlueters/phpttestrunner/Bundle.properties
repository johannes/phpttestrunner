    This is a module for the NetBeans IDE to run phpt tests, display a summary and shows details of failed tests.\n\n\
    This plugin uses a special version of the run-tests.php script from the PHP distribution to run tests following the phpt format. \
    These tests are mostly used by developers of the PHP runtime but can also be used by other projects. \
    When a test fails the user will get a diff showing the differences and an editor window to change the test.
